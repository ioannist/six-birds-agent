\begin{abstract}
In \SBT\ (\citep{six_birds_theory}), macroscopic objects are induced by layers/closures, yet empirical discussions of agency often conflate persistence (being an object) with control (making a difference), making agency claims hard to verify and easy to fake. We propose a type-correct \SBT\ account: a theory is an induced layer $T=(\Pi,L,\mathcal F,B)$; an agent is a \emph{theory object}---a maintained package inside $T$ with a ledger-gated interface. Operationally, we instantiate this contract as exact finite controlled kernels with (i) ledger-gated feasibility, (ii) robust viability kernels under successor-support semantics, (iii) feasible empowerment (channel capacity) as a difference-making proxy, and (iv) an empirical packaging endomap whose idempotence defect measures objecthood for coarse lenses. Across matched-control ablations in a minimal ring-world, we obtain four checkable separations: (1) in calibrated nulls, single-action regimes have 0-bit empowerment and an exogenous-schedule trap yields 1 bit only under the wrong model (0 under the correct one); (2) enabling repair collapses idempotence defect at $\tau=2$ from 1 to 0; (3) enabling protocol holonomy leaves $H=1$ unchanged but increases empowerment for $H\ge2$; and (4) operator rewriting (skill $\theta$) monotonically increases median empowerment (0.73$\to$1.34 bits). These results separate agenthood from agency with audited, hash-traceable artifacts. We are explicit that stronger claims about goals, consciousness, or real organisms are not established here; our conclusions rely on finite witnesses and operational proxies under explicit controls.
