\begin{abstract}
We present a reproducible computational framework for defining and measuring agency in finite controlled Markov kernels without assuming goals, utilities, or homunculi. The framework operationalizes three complementary metrics: (i)~viability kernels (greatest controlled-invariant safe sets under ledger-gated feasibility and successor-support semantics), (ii)~feasible empowerment (channel capacity of the induced action-to-output channel restricted by budgets), and (iii)~an empirical packaging endomap whose idempotence defect quantifies objecthood for coarse lenses. Building on Six Birds Theory (SBT, \citep{six_birds_theory}), we propose that an agent is a \emph{theory object}---a maintained package inside an induced layer with a ledger-gated interface---and we separate \emph{agenthood} (enablement: the layer exists and persists) from \emph{agency} (causation: interface interventions change outside futures). Throughout, ``theory'' is used in the SBT technical sense---a closure (lens + completion + audit)---not as a speculative hypothesis or manuscript-type category. Across matched-control ablations in a minimal ring-world substrate, we obtain four auditable separations: (1)~calibrated null regimes prevent false positives (single-action: 0-bit empowerment; schedule trap: 1~bit under the wrong model, 0 under the correct one); (2)~enabling repair collapses idempotence defect at $\tau=2$ from 1 to 0; (3)~enabling protocol holonomy leaves $H=1$ unchanged but increases empowerment for $H\ge2$; and (4)~operator rewriting (skill $\theta$) monotonically increases median empowerment ($0.73\to1.34$ bits). All experiments are driven by deterministic, hash-traceable scripts with a strict audit mode, and a Lean~4 anchor formalizes the viability-kernel fixed-point property. We are explicit that stronger claims about goals, consciousness, or real organisms are not established here; our conclusions rely on finite witnesses and operational proxies under explicit controls.
